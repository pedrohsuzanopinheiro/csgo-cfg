# My personal CSGO .cfg

All the credits to the original author of the file: [u8Jj3](https://github.com/u8Jj3)

I just changed it to my own personal settings.

## Installation

Download and place the `autoexec.cfg` in your `\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg` folder.

To execute the .cfg in game, open your console and type `exec autoexec`

To make it start with your game launch, open CSGO launch options and add `+exec autoexec`
